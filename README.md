Testing environment for untested code and outright experimentation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
## List of subjects to be discussed

1. New type of input objects for two-point analysis

2. The procedure to obtain the the recombination fraction matrices is slower in F2 due to the dominant markers. Suggestion: provide a vector containing the type of the markers, similar to the outcrossing procedure

## Efficiency of the two-point procedure
